# Introduction

This short course is aimed at humanities scholars interested in tapping into the data streams and functionality offered by social media platforms such as Twitter. Social Media Analysis in the humanities 
will show you the power of Python, a scripting language widely used in industry and the academy because of its human readability. We will proceed to the fundamentals of working with Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), the most common way to programmatically access web-based services and data.  Participants will use DH Box, a cloud-based digital humanities laboratory, for their development environment. 

This is a hands-on course. Consider this offering in complement with Fundamentals of Programming, CloudPowering DH Research, Practical Software Development for Nontraditional Digital Humanities Developers, or Introduction to Data for Digital Humanities Projects; and more!
