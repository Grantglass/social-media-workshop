# Course Introduction

This short course is aimed at humanities scholars interested in tapping into the data streams offered by social media platforms such as Twitter. Social Media Analysis in the humanities will discuss the implications of this type on research on teaching and publication. The class will briefly show you the power of Python, a scripting language widely used in industry and the academy because of its human readability. We will proceed to the fundamentals of working with Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), through Twitter. Participants will use DH Box, a cloud-based digital humanities laboratory, for their development environment. 

This is a hands-on course. Consider this offering in complement with Fundamentals of Programming, CloudPowering DH Research, Practical Software Development for Nontraditional Digital Humanities Developers, or Introduction to Data for Digital Humanities Projects; and more!

# Introduction

Grant Glass is a PhD student in English and Comparative Literature at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My scholarship focuses on the migration of 18th-century books within the British Empire and how particular editions (pirated, abridged, childrenâ€™s, imitated, translated) propagated nefarious notions of capitalism, race, empire, gender, and climate throughout the Atlantic. I am interested in social media research to see how people concieve and consume 18th century texts in the digital age.
